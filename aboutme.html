<h4>A Journey of Growth, Learning, and Discovery.</h4>
My name is Khileshor Adhikari, and I am constantly evolving.<br>

<h4>As a child, I was always curious. </h4><br>
Whether it was reading books, asking questions, or exploring the world around me, I had an innate drive to learn and understand. <br>

These early interests would later influence the direction of my education and career.<br>

<h4>Building Knowledge and Skills.</h4>
As I grew older, education became one of the cornerstones of my life.<br> 
I attended school where I studied basic and technical related subjects. <br>
During this time, I discovered a deeper passion for Techniocal field, which leding me to pursue . 
The academic challenges and intellectual stimulation I experienced during these years taught me valuable skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication.<br>

But my education wasn‚Äôt limited to the classroom. <br>
